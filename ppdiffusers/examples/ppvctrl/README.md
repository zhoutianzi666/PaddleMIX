# PP-VCtrl
**PP-VCtrl** is a controllable video generation model that uses an auxiliary condition encoder to transform a text-to-video generation model into a custom video generator, without retraining of the original generator. 

The model employs a unified encoding process to convert various control inputs into standardized formats，along with sparse residual connections to efficiently integrate controllable information into the generator. Additionally, it applies task-specific masks to enhance adaptability. 

These design features make PP-VCtrl suitable for a wide range of video generation tasks, such as **character animation**, **scene transitions**, and **video editing**.

## 📚 Technical Details

### 1. PP-VCtrl
In the digital creative industry, video generation has become a key tool for content creation and storytelling. While text-to-video diffusion models have enabled language-driven video generation, controlling fine spatiotemporal features remains a major challenge. In scenarios like advertising, film post-production, live-streaming sales, and virtual character interactions, text input alone cannot precisely specify visual features such as object outlines, human poses, or scene backgrounds, requiring more accurate control signals. The current trial-and-error approach of adjusting text descriptions is inefficient and cannot fully meet the need for precise control.

Although ControlNet has made breakthroughs in controllable image generation, there is no universal control solution for video generation. Existing research focuses on task-specific solutions, leading to fragmentation and limiting flexibility across tasks. Some methods try to control video by adjusting image generation models, which affects temporal consistency and overall quality.

To solve these issues, we propose PP-VCtrl, a unified framework that uses auxiliary condition encoders to provide flexible, precise control of various signals while maintaining efficient performance. It is well-suited for tasks requiring precise control, such as character animation, scene transitions, and video editing.

### 2. Data Strategy

Compared to text/image-to-video generation, controllable video generation requires data that not only meets visual quality and text-video alignment but also needs to be constructed according to different controllable tasks. We build an original dataset pool by collecting publicly available video datasets. After splitting the raw data into single shots, removing black edges, watermarks, and subtitles, we filter the data based on aesthetic quality scores to obtain a usable data pool. Using the usable data pool, we perform recaption, human keypoint extraction, and video segmentation to meet the data requirements for Canny, Pose, and Mask video editing tasks. The process is as shown in the diagram below:
<img src="assets/models/data1.png" style="width:100%">
Through the above process, we obtained the training data distribution for controllable video generation across different tasks:
<img src="assets/models/data2.png" style="width:100%">

### 3. Training Strategy
To enhance the model's generalization ability and robustness, we adopted diverse data augmentation and training strategies. During the denoising process, we sample time steps using a sine function to better focus on key stages of video generation. In the spatial dimension, we use a default cropping strategy based on a normal distribution, adapting the crop according to the video's aspect ratio. This approach increases data diversity while ensuring that the model effectively focuses on the main content of the video.

We also designed specific optimization strategies for different tasks. For edge control tasks, we use dynamic threshold sampling to increase data diversity. For human pose control tasks, we employ separate padding and cropping preprocessing strategies for landscape and portrait videos. In mask control tasks, we apply a multi-target sampling method based on area-weighted probability distributions, dynamically selecting target areas and supporting region expansion and multi-target joint control. Additionally, random probability-based dilation is used to improve the model's robustness and make the generated results more natural.

These strategies are integrated into the unified video generation control framework, significantly improving the model's adaptability and generation quality across various scenarios, while fully leveraging the advantages of the PP-VCtrl universal control framework.

### 4. Quantitative Metrics
In the quantitative evaluation of edge control video generation (Canny), human pose control video generation (Pose), and mask control video generation (Mask) tasks, the PPVCtrl model excels or surpasses existing open-source task-specific methods in both control ability and video quality metrics.
<img src="assets/models/eval1.png" style="width:100%">

We conducted manual evaluation experiments, inviting multiple evaluators to score videos generated by different methods. The evaluation dimensions included overall video quality, temporal consistency, and more. The results showed that PPVCtrl outperformed existing open-source methods in all evaluation dimensions.
